simple-dependencies-manager
===========================

Imagine this scenario: you are a software engineer and works in a somewhat big project and have dependencies for another projects of yours.

For example, you're now working at project_a that has depencies of project_b and project_c. Both project_b and project_c are pypi projects and project_a demands any channges in b and c.

Now imagine yourself hard developing project_a that demands lots of changes in project_b and project_c. And you have to package both dependencies each producition deployment you do.

Sounds crazy? Yeah...

With simple-dependencies-manager, you can create a new version of your dependencies, pull versions to git and upload to your egg repository.

As simple as:

	python simple-manager -f config.yaml --(pull|clone|push|tag)

This way, you will pull both project from git.
